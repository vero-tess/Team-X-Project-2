Team-X-Project-2
================

Our java web application to help students find out where seminars with and without free food are located on campus. We use a coloring scheme to denote where food/seminars are located. The dark blue is dining halls with the link to the campus dish website to allow the user to see what is currently being offered at the dining halls. The red is seminars with food, yellow is seminars without food, and the purple is a list of clubs that have food.
